# Password Generator
I made this password generator as a project in my learning journey of JavaScript.

## Features
* Allows you to select between 8-16 characters.
* Password changes as soon as you move the slider, no need to submit the lenght value manually.
* Allows you to randomize the password.
* Allows you to copy the password by press of a button.
* Responsive design, works on all popular devices.
